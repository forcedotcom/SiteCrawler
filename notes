Remove hardcoded username/password etc from rabbitmq
make choice for scheduler an environment option (local vs rabbitmq)
Make the parsers work (now they are empty on the client)

Later:
For every crawl, use a new ID. This ID should be attached to the URL into rabbitMQ
This should also go back once it's parsed, back into the master
